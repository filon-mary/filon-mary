### Hi there 👋, I'm Maria Filonova - aka filon-mary 😄

👀 I have always been interested in mathematics and Data Science. Therefore, after receiving higher education in economics at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, I decided to get additional knowledge and am now completing my studies at Yandex on Data Science ML.

💞️ I am passionate about working with big data. It gives me a sense of feeling
It brings deep satisfaction with a positive result, as I am aware of the benefits of such work. During my studies, I managed to get to know neural networks better, which also turned out to be very interesting for me and I would like to develop in this direction as well.

🌱 During my studies I solved 15 cases

⚡ The stack used:
Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, bootstrap, LightGBM, CatBoost, statsmodels, BERT, nltk, tf-idf, Keras, PyTorch, A/B-tests.
